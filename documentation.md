Goals:
My goal for this IDP is to personalize my own flappy bird game through watching a tutorial on YouTube. I hope to become more familiar with implementing moving parts into my code.



Updates:
•	Today, I first started with searching up YouTube videos on coding projects in p5.js because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do yet and was looking for some inspiration. I found a beginner tutorial for creating the flappy bird game, so I think I am going create my own spin off of flappy bird.
•	I tried to start creating my own game by creating two new pages in my replit, one for creating the bird and one for the pipes. I followed along the video and started making some progress. 
•	I began coding, using the help of the YouTube video. 


Reflections about what I’ve learned:
Through this project, I learned to use this. which refers to the current object of a method or constructor. I also learned how to use objects in order to make the bird and pipes preform certain functions.





When revising this project, I hope to first get it to work properly and also add a score and change the colors of the bird, pipes, and background.
