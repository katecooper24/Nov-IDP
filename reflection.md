While creating this project, I learned how to implement each of the six things. I used variables for the bird, pipes, and score. I used functions for figuring out if the bird hit the pipes.

When revising, I basically restarted the project because when I submitted this in November, it wasn't working so I wanted to get it to work better. I was hoping to add a score but I couldn't figure that out.
